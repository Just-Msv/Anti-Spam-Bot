# Anti-Spam-Bot
An anti-spam/anti-raid bot for discord. It detects the number of messages being sent in a chat. Every time a message us sent, the bot stores the message in a .txt file and it's an async event so it'll be called personally for every time someone sends a message to the chat which is then counted. If it exceeds a certain threshold, the bot removes the user from the server.

## Setup ( Replit or Glitch )

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/MSVFORYOU/Anti-Spam-Bot)](https://repl.it/github/MSVFORYOU/Anti-Spam-Bot)

- Install the required modules!
- Create a bot application at the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and add to your discord server.
- Install the required modules!
- Allow the "Server Member Intent" under the "Privileged Gateway Intents" in the [discord developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications). (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! The bot will not work propertly without and will not be able to find or kick server members.)
